## Description

The Pokemon Encounter Web App is an interactive application that allows users to encounter and view different Pokémon. The app pulls data from the PokeAPI to render information about each Pokémon, including its name, image, types, and a sound button that plays its cry. Users can encounter individual Pokémon or a group of six Pokémon at once.

### Functionality

- Encounter a Single Pokémon: Clicking the "Encounter a Pokémon" button fetches a random Pokémon from the PokeAPI and displays its details (name, image, types, and a "Play Sound" button).

- Encounter a Group of Six Pokémon: Clicking the "Encounter 6 Pokémon At Once" button fetches six random Pokémon and displays them simultaneously, each with its unique information.

- Sound Playback: Each Pokémon has a button that plays its sound when clicked, allowing users to hear its cry.

### Features

1.  Random Pokémon Retrieval: A random Pokémon is fetched from the PokeAPI, ensuring each encounter is unique.

2.  Multiple Encounters: Users can either encounter a single Pokémon or six Pokémon at once, making it more exciting to explore various Pokémon.

3.  Dynamic Rendering: Pokémon data, including images, types, and names, are dynamically rendered as cards on the page.

4.  Sound Feature: Each Pokémon card includes a button to play the corresponding sound/cry of the Pokémon.

5.  Responsive Layout: The app's interface is styled with responsive design in mind, ensuring that the Pokémon cards and buttons are well-organized and easy to use across different screen sizes.
